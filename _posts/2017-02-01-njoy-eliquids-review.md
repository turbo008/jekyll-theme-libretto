Users have said the liquids have a specific quality that sets them apart from their competitors. The liquids are high quality, as can be expected with a brand such as NJOY. The blend is mixture that gives a good throat hit, as well as highly produces vapors. The quality lies primarily in the taste of the e-liquids. They are described as tasting exactly like the labels claim they should. Many e-liquids from other providers only flavor slightly. NJOY has taken flavor creation to the next level. They provide some of the best e-juice flavors on the market.

The standard bottle sized 10 mg, which are sold are $7.99 (plus shipping, if you're shopping online). These liquids are available in certain stores as well, which might limit your expenses. There are a variety of flavors, from the basics of tobacco and menthol. Their best flavor has been rated as the Double Espresso, since they nailed the taste of coffee so perfectly. They also offer a peach flavored e-liquid called Peach Tea, as one of many other fruit flavored liquids. Their fruit and dessert flavors are rated as some of the most delicious e-liquids on the market. The taste quality, as we've already discussed, sets these liquids ahead. 

Along with the high quality and flavor-filled bursts, there are other benefits to the NJOY e-liquids. These benefits include the packing their liquids come in. They are stored in child-safety bottles, which means you don't have to worry about your child getting a hold of your liquids. Of course, they should always be stored away from children, but, we all know how sneaky a curious child can be. At least you can rest knowing they can't get into the bottle and drink the entire thing down. The packaging is also simple. so you can access your liquids quickly. 

NJOY has been continuously expanding their product line, trying to please their customers to the best of their ability. This has included expanding on tanks as well as providing the premium e-liquids we're looking at.

One of the cutting edge decisions that NJOY has made to reach out to consumers is the Artist Collection of e-liquids. These are liquids that are designed and created by famous faces in the vaping Universe. These special e-liquids give the same taste quality, while being something you'll never find at another company. They are definitely worth a try, especially if you're one of those vapers who want to get in on the latest and greatest e-liquids.

Overall, NJOY provides high quality and the cost doesn't feel like a compromise. While the bottles aren't offered in much variety (10 and 15 mg only), they are still worth investing in. A premium taste is worth a premium price â€“ but NJOY knows how to give back to their customers, providing quality with only a minimal price tag. Whether you're interested in switching or a loyal brand lover, it doesn't hurt to give one of their e-liquids a try.
