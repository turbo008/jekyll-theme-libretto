The method is simple. If you were to choose a switch to e-cigarettes, you would be able to control your own nicotine content. The e-liquid for these cigarettes allow you to choose the nicotine level, as well as a variety of flavors. Often, people find themselves switching from cigarettes to the method of vaping simply because there are more flavor options. If you were to add up the flavors available from every company on the market, you might come up with over 300, 000 different flavor combinations. That means that your smoking can match your taste buds, changing each day. It's far less expensive than buying flavored cigarettes. In fact, it's less expensive than smoking in general.

The initial cost to purchasing an e-cigarette unit and a [collection of top vaping flavors](http://www.bestejuiceflavors.net) may seem steep. But you might want to compare the cost over time. Smoking was deemed one of the most expensive habits, with individuals often spending $10 a day for their cigarettes.

But how does an e-cigarette help you quit smoking, you ask? Isn't it just replacing one addiction with another. This is potentially the case, if you're not fully committed to the idea of quitting smoking. If you are, this method is reliable, safe and effective.

You would start with buying e-liquids that have the nicotine content you're used to in your cigarettes. The highest content available. Slowly, you will decrease your nicotine levels. Each time you buy a new e-liquid, you'll purchase a lower nicotine content. Slowly, as you decrease your levels, you'll notice the nicotine addiction leaving your system. This gradual decrease saves you the craving of nicotine as well as the withdrawals you might experience if you tried another method of quitting.

You may decide to even buy two kits, having a variety of [e-cigarettes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_cigarette) available to you. They might be different flavors, so you can switch them out whenever you feel like. You might also choose to have those other e-cigarettes be nicotine-free. This way, you're not inhaling the nicotine every single time you inhale from one of your e-cigarettes. This is another good method to reducing how much nicotine is in your system. Of course, you can do this while also decreasing the nicotine content in your e-liquids.

The reason this method is so effective is because gradually taking yourself away from any addiction is the best way to ease your body and mind into no longer needing said addiction. Cigarettes, being the worst addiction, need to be approached with this method, if you want to truly quit them for good.
